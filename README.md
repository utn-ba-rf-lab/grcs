This repository is organized to house GNU Radio flowgraphs for some Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) and emulations. These resources are utilized in Communication System courses at UTN-FRBA.

It is organized in the following way: there are folders named after the corresponding Software-Defined Radios (SDRs). Inside each folder, you'll find specific flowgraphs tailored for the respective SDRs.

For example, you can find a flowgraph to receive Broadcast FM with RTL-SDR. Alternatively, there's a flowgraph to transmit AM using HackRF One. Additionally, there is a folder called 'varios' with flowgraphs for emulations. The flowgraphs inside require a file with signal samples to either emulate a reception or simulate a transmitted signal.

For example, there are flowgraphs for simulating AM or FM signals with one or two tones.
